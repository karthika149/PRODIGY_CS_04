A **keylogger** (short for "keystroke logger") is a type of software or hardware tool that tracks and records every keystroke made on a keyboard. Keyloggers are commonly used for:

1. **Malicious Purposes**: Hackers may use keyloggers to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or private messages.
   
2. **Legitimate Uses**: Employers might use keyloggers to monitor employee activity, or parents may use them to keep track of their children's online behavior.

Keyloggers can be categorized as:  
- **Software Keyloggers**: Programs that run on a device to monitor and log keystrokes.  
- **Hardware Keyloggers**: Physical devices connected between a keyboard and computer to intercept and record input.  

They are considered a cybersecurity threat when used without consent.
